# Voxel height map engine using ray casting

My initial attempt at ray casting. Just a small project for the fun of it.
Background info and theory available at [flipcode - Realtime Voxel Landscape Engines](http://www.flipcode.com/archives/Realtime_Voxel_Landscape_Engines-Part_1_Introduction.shtml).
Code is a bit messy, and was mostly meant as a proof of concept. The graphics used are
from an old game called Comanche, which also used ray-casting to render graphics.

Originally I wanted to make a game based on voxels, since I have always been fascinated 
with the smooth graphics in games like Outcast and Delta Force.
